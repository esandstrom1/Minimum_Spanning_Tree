Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms

This program demonstrates an implementation of three algorithms for generating a minimum spanning tree from a list of edges. The algorithms are Prim's, Kruskal's, and Kruskal's with path compression. The individual runtimes will be output to STDERR. Graphical runtime representation can be can be found in the accompanying excel file.


Execution:
Compile and run with "make run" to run all tests and redirect outputs to .txt files
or
Compile with "make" and run with individual graph file passed by command line argument
e.g. 	./mst graphs/graph_v100_e150.txt > v100_output.txt
